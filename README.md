Abstract :
Snake Game is a video game that originated during the late 1970s in arcades and has maintained popularity since then, becoming something of a classic. After it became the standard pre-loaded game on Nokia phones in 1998, Snake found a massive audience.

Project Introduction 
The project is a “2D Snake game”. We try to make this game little bit different from the Snake game we often play cell phones. Mostly this game is compared with NOKIA 1100 Series snake game and tried to make game slightly different from NOKIA snake game. Games in our cell phones have only one food which is kept at rest and snake has to eat food so as to grow. But in our game we will include different types of foods having different shapes and will move in different directions with speed less then snakes speed. 
Also we had included in the game the poison which will be released when ‘z’ button from the keyboard has been pressed. The poison will be in the form of fire and will help the snake to catch & eat food much easier. We had also introduced Menu’s for increasing & decreasing snake speed during play time.
We will use data files for storing our player’s names, scores and their high scores as well in Encrypted form using XOR encryption algorithm.

Main features of our game are as follows:
•	Moving foods having different shapes, colors and speeds.
•	Snake possess poison in form of fire which will move in forward direction (like bombs released by Mario).
•	Allow user to speed up and down snake during game play as well. 
•	Hurdles in form of flying predator bird to increase difficulty level.
•	Auto save Feature is provided so that user can load his/her saved game in future whenever required.
•	Little bit Artificial Intelligence is provided to moving foods for prevent them being eaten by snake.
•	Storing players name and score as well as their high score in encrypted form in data files by XOR Cypher encryption algorithm.
